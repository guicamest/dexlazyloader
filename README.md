Dex Lazy Loader (DYL)
======

*Call me when you need me! - Somebody*

Dex Lazy Loader (DYL) library and plugin were born as a result of reading Macarse's Lazy Loading Dex files article. If you haven't read it yet, I strongly recommend you do before considering using DYL.

The library provides a LazyLoader to load dexed jars on runtime.

The plugin takes care of dexing provided dependencies and jars located at dyl folder into your assets folder.
